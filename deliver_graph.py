Deliver a pack tree to a Microsoft Graph drive, so a consumer that cannot fetch artifacts
can still read the day.

    python3 deliver_graph.py --packs packs --shard 1 --date 2026-08-10

WHICH HALF OF THIS FILE THIS REPOSITORY USES. Both, but not the same way. The Graph client
below — the token, the retry set, the upload session, the archive builder, the state read
back off the drive — is what `deliver_ee.py` delivers this country's day with, and it is
shared rather than copied so that two deliveries cannot drift apart on which HTTP code to
retry. The `main()` at the bottom is the SHARDED entry point, written for a portal that
refuses a third of runner addresses and is therefore fetched by four runners at once. EPPS
refuses none, so no workflow here calls it. It is kept whole, with its tests, because those
tests are the proof of the machinery `deliver_lt` stands on.

EACH TENDER HAS ONE HOME, AND A DAY IS A LIST OF WHAT MOVED.

    tenders/<pid>/          the tender itself: doc/, its manifests, index.json, state.json,
                            seen.json, runs/<date>.json, and the whole thing as one ZIP
    <date>/shards/…/        the day: the shard index, which carries each tender's change
                            record inline, beside the shard's own accounting files

A tender delivered a second time uploads only the documents that were not there before.
Everything else — every unchanged document, which on an ordinary re-fetch is nearly all of
them — stays exactly where it already is, and `index.json` in the home goes on naming it,
so a reader that wants the tender whole never has to know which day any part of it arrived.

A tender that did not move at all writes only `seen.json` and `runs/<date>.json`, both of
which are a few hundred bytes. Nothing else in the home needs rewriting, because nothing
about the tender is different.

READING THE DESTINATION IS WHAT MAKES THAT POSSIBLE. A run remembers nothing: the runner is
new and the previous run's artifact is precisely what a consumer cannot reach. So the state
each tender was left in is read back out of the drive itself, with the credential this job
already holds — see `get`. No cache, no committed file, no second service.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A GitHub artifact's metadata is served by api.github.com but its bytes are
a 302 to `*.blob.core.windows.net` — a different host, from a rotating pool. A consumer
allowed to reach the first and not the second can list an artifact, see its size, see that
it has not expired, and download none of it. That is not a permissions problem anyone can
grant their way out of; the bytes have to arrive somewhere the consumer may already talk to.

WHAT THIS KNOWS ABOUT THE DESTINATION: NOTHING. Tenant, client, drive and path all arrive in
the environment. This file names no organisation, no site and no folder, and it prints
counts rather than paths, so neither the repository nor the run log says where the day went.
The one thing it cannot hide is the TLS connection itself: a runner talking to Graph resolves
`login.microsoftonline.com` and `graph.microsoft.com`, and whoever can watch the runner's
network sees that much. Scope the credential to one site (`Sites.Selected`) and a leak buys
the reader that site and nothing else.

WHY THE DOCUMENT PATHS ARE FLATTENED. Paths inside a pack run deep — an archive nested a
few levels holds documents whose relative path is already hundreds of characters — and a
SharePoint destination prefix adds its own on top of a hard limit for the whole
server-relative path. A minority of a day's files therefore fail to upload while the rest
succeed, and a delivery that loses a fraction of itself and reports success is the failure
mode this pipeline exists to refuse. So `normalized/<deep>/<path>/document.md` is written
as `doc/<digest>.md` and `manifest_normalized.json` is rewritten to match.

That rewrite is safe because of how a consumer reads: it opens `entry["markdown_path"]`
and never parses its shape, while the name a person sees and cites is `entry["source"]`,
which is left exactly as the carrier wrote it.

The digest is also what lets an unchanged document stay where it lies: a name derived from
the file's own bytes is the same name tomorrow. See `flatten`.

PARTIAL SUCCESS IS FAILURE, here as everywhere else in this tool. Any file that does not
land fails the run, because a day that looks delivered and is not costs more than one that
plainly broke.
