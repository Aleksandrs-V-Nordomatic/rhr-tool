"""Deliver an Estonian day to a Graph drive, and give the day a memory.

    python3 deliver_ee.py --out work --date 2026-09-04

WHY THIS IS NOT `deliver_graph`. The two deliveries agree about almost everything — the same
Graph client, the same home layout, the same rule that an index is written after the files it
names — and they are separate because a delivery written for another country's register does
specific, quiet damage to this one's tenders:

  * it REBUILDS `index.json` from `procurement.json` and the normalized manifest. This
    country's index is not derivable from those: it carries what the register stamped on each
    catalogue entry as the moment that document last changed, and the document type the
    register assigned it. Both come from the catalogue and both are gone by the time
    `procurement.json` is written. A rebuilt index is a correct-looking index with the two
    facts a person needs missing.
  * its download address is a literal belonging to another register. Pointed here it does not
    fail; it stamps a working foreign URL shape onto an Estonian procurement, and the card
    carries a link to a document that is not the one it names.
  * a shard is in its path, because four runners draw four addresses at a register that
    refuses a third of them. This one refuses none, so there is one runner, no shard index to
    reconcile, and no collection step.

So this file delivers WHAT THE FETCH ALREADY BUILT rather than reassembling it. `ee_fetch`
writes the index, and the index it wrote is the one that ships.

WHERE THE MEMORY LIVES, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE THE DISK. `ee_day` compares each procurement
against `state.json` in its own home — correct on a workstation that keeps `work/` between
runs, and worthless on a runner, whose disk is new every night. Every procurement would come
back `new`, `changes.json` would be a copy of the day for ever, and the half of the night that
reports what moved would have nothing true to say.

The drive is the only durable thing in the arrangement, so the comparison is made against the
drive, here, at delivery. The local `changes.json` is overwritten with the result before it is
uploaded, so the file a reader finds is the one that was compared against what the reader can
actually see.

WHAT IT KNOWS ABOUT THE DESTINATION: NOTHING. Tenant, client, drive and root arrive in the
environment; the country picks the folder under the root; and this file prints counts rather
than paths.

# every document is already delivered as Markdown and the index carries the register's own
# address for anyone who wants the original itself. The raw archive stays behind for the same
# reason, and its name is reused for the archive of what did travel: a reader that takes
# `<pid>.zip` wants the procurement readable in one request, not a folder of .docx.
