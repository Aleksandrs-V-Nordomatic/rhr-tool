"""The delivered tender, tested without a drive.

Two properties carry this file.

An index exists because a reader has one context window and a day of extracted text is tens
of millions of characters, so every tender carries its own copy and it is written after the
documents it names.

And a tender fetched again is mostly the tender that was fetched before — the same forty
documents, one of them replaced, a deadline moved a week. Sending all forty again is the
expensive way to say so, and it answers nothing a consumer asks. So the tests below hold what
the second delivery of a tender costs, and what it says.
