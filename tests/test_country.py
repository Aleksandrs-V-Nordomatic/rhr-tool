"""One run is one country, and the failure these tests exist to prevent succeeds quietly.

A run that reads one register and writes under another country's folder uploads cleanly,
produces a valid index, and hands that country's reader the wrong tenders with nothing
anywhere saying so. There
is no error to notice. So the rule is structural rather than checked after the fact: the
source and the destination are both derived from one resolved code, and every way of
expressing a mismatch is refused at the point it is expressed.

THIS REPOSITORY FETCHES ONE COUNTRY, AND THAT MAKES THE CHECK MORE IMPORTANT, NOT LESS.
Another country's code is one this tool has no source for, so it is refused here by the
same line that refuses `EE` — which is exactly the guarantee a country-per-repository split
has to provide. This tool cannot be pointed at another country's register, and it cannot be
pointed at another country's folder.
