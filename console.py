"""Printing Estonian without letting the terminal end the run.

Everything here is Estonian: tender titles, filenames, extracted document text. On a Windows
console the default codec cannot encode `ā`, and `print()` then raises — which killed a CLI
once on the first tender title it tried to show, and killed a library function again later
because a caller's stdout happened to be cp1252.

Two rules follow, and they are different:

  * A COMMAND may reconfigure its own streams to UTF-8. `utf8_streams()` does that.
  * A LIBRARY may not — the streams belong to whoever called it. So `say()` prints, and on
    a codec it cannot satisfy falls back to a lossy rendering instead of raising.

Progress output is never worth a traceback. The work is already done by the time we are
describing it.
