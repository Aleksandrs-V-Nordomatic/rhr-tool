"""The recall gate: which notices are worth fetching, before a single byte moves.

WHY IT IS ITS OWN FILE. This is the one piece of judgement that is not about a country. A
CPV code means the same thing wherever it is filed, and the terms a caller recalls on are
their business rather than a portal's — so every country tool in this family runs the
identical rule, from a copy of this file, and none of them has to import another's driver
to get it.

WHAT THIS KNOWS ABOUT THE CALLER'S INTEREST: NOTHING — the same rule deliver_graph.py keeps
about its destination. The terms arrive in the environment, so this file names no industry,
no trade and no target, and a reader of this repository learns the shape of the filter
without learning what anyone points it at.

# THE ONE FILTER ALLOWED BEFORE A DOCUMENT EXISTS.
#
# A title is kept when it contains one of the caller's recall roots. Roots are matched as
# substrings rather than as whole words because the language this runs against inflects
# heavily; precision belongs to the later document-reading step, not to a title.
#
# Two guards matter, and both fail toward fetching:
#   * no text at all means no evidence, so the notice is fetched;
#   * a classification code never vetoes a matching title, because the code is assigned by
#     the buyer and an imperfect one must not silently drop a notice whose title matches.
#
# Exclusions win over recall, and exclusion by code prefix covers notices whose title is
# absent or unhelpful.

# A title is the obvious surface and in most countries it is the only one. This register
# publishes a second for free: `mainCpvName` — the Estonian name of the classification the
# buyer chose — and it is worth reading, because a buyer will often write a short and
# meaningless title and then classify the purchase precisely. The title says "Aamse ja Nihka
# küla, KIRI" and the classification says what is actually being bought.
#
# It matters more here than it would elsewhere: the search row carries no description at all
# (`shortDescription` is empty on every row the register serves) and no classification CODE,
# only its name. So these two texts are everything the gate has, and dropping one of them
# would put the whole weight on a title that buyers do not write for us.

# This is what makes a SHORT term safe to write. A recall list for a language full of
# abbreviations needs entries like ` ats `, ` kv ` and ` vk `, and each of them is written
# with spaces around it precisely so it cannot match inside a longer word. That only works if
# the text is spaced the same way: without this, `KV,` and `(VK)` never match because of the
# punctuation, and a term at the very start or end of a title never matches because there is
# no space beyond it. Both failures are silent and both drop tenders.
#
# `[\W_]+` under Unicode keeps every letter and digit, Estonian ones included, and collapses
# everything else. It is deliberately not a named character class: a hand-written one has to
# list the language's letters, and the letter somebody forgets is the one that splits a word
# in half and stops a term matching it.
