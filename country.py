"""Which country a run is for, and everything that follows from it.

One run is one country. The tool fetches from that country's portal and publishes under
that country's folder, and the two must never come apart — a run reading one register and
writing under another country's folder is a failure that succeeds: the upload returns 200,
the index is valid, and a reader is handed the wrong country's tenders with nothing anywhere
saying so.

This repository is the Estonian tool and reads RHR only. The check below still runs, and
still refuses, because a country tool that assumes its own country is a country tool that
cannot say when it was pointed at the wrong drive.

So the country is resolved once, here, and both the source and the destination are derived
from it rather than configured beside it. Configuring them separately is what makes the
mismatch expressible in the first place.

THE DESTINATION IS DERIVED, NOT CONFIGURED. `GRAPH_DEST_ROOT` names the project's runtime
folder — the `work/` a reader knows — and the country code is appended to it. It is not
enough to ask the deployment to set `GRAPH_DEST_ROOT` to `…/work/EE` and trust it: that is
the same two-places-to-get-right this file exists to remove, and the first symptom of
getting it wrong is a day of one country's tenders sitting in another's folder. A root that
already ends in a country code is therefore refused rather than appended to, because
`work/EE/EE` is the other way the same mistake shows up.

THE SOURCE IS DERIVED TOO. A code with no source module is refused, never guessed at and
never quietly served by the other country's reader.
