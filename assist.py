Read the files the deterministic extractor honestly could not — and nothing else.

    python3 assist.py --pack out                       # local OCR: no account, no key
    python3 assist.py --pack out --provider gemini     # a model, if a key is configured
    python3 assist.py --pack out --dry-run             # what would be read, and by what

WHY THE DEFAULT READER IS A LOCAL ONE, AND NOT A MODEL. The first version of this file
required `GEMINI_API_KEY`, which meant the pipeline depended on a personal account that
nothing in this repository owns. That is a worse problem than an unread scan: a credential
with no owner fails silently, at the worst moment, and cannot be handed over.

So the default reader is **Tesseract with the Estonian language pack, installed on the
runner**. It needs no account, no key, no e-mail, no billing relationship and no
migration plan. It is worse than a frontier model on a bad scan and entirely adequate on
a clean one — and the volume argues it is enough: the deterministic extractor reads most
tenders whole, leaving this lane an ordinarily empty queue. Buying a cloud dependency to
serve a queue that is usually empty is the wrong trade.

A hosted model stays available for the day a scan defeats Tesseract; it is one flag and
one secret, and `PROVIDERS` below is the only place that has to know it exists.

WHY THIS DOES NOT BREAK THE "NO MODEL" RULE. The rule was always about the MAIN path: same
bytes in, same text out, and a coverage claim that can be checked. That still holds — this
step never touches a file the extractor could read, and never rewrites `normalized/`.

What it works on is the queue the extractor already produces and names: `unreadable_files`
in `manifest_normalized.json`, each entry carrying a digest and a reason. Today those are
honest holes — a scanned PDF is reported `no text layer` and that is the end of it. A hole
a person still has to open by hand is not more honest than a hole read by a model and
labelled as such; it is only cheaper to defend.

FOUR PROPERTIES MAKE IT SAFE TO KEEP:

**Quarantined.** Output lands in `llm/`, never in `normalized/`. Every entry is marked
`llm-fallback`, so a downstream reader can always tell which characters a machine
transcribed from a picture and which a decoder recovered from a text layer. A consumer
that requires located quotes must treat this text as a reason to look, never as the quote.

**Cached by content.** The key is the file's sha256. A digest already answered is never
sent again, so a re-run is byte-identical and costs nothing — determinism's honest cousin,
and the reason a warm run still reports zero tokens like the deterministic core does.

**Provenance or it did not happen.** Every answer is written beside a record of which
provider, model and prompt produced it, and when. A transcription whose origin is unknown
is worse than a gap, because a gap does not look like evidence.

**Free by default, and bounded.** The provider is Google's free tier, which for EEA users
carries the paid-tier data terms — the submitted documents are not used for training. Free
quota is finite, so the run paces itself and stops cleanly: anything left over is marked
`llm-deferred` and the next run picks it up. Running out of quota is not a failure.

NOT SENT, EVER: drawings (DWG/DXF) — a named non-goal with PDF duplicates in practice;
files the extractor read perfectly well; and anything the caller did not ask for by reason.
