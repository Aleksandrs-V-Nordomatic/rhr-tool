"""What changed about one tender since the last time it was fetched.

Pure functions over a pack's own JSON. No network, no model, no clock: the same pack
compared against the same previous state answers the same thing on any machine, which is
the only reason this is worth having at all. A consumer that must re-read a tender because
it cannot tell whether anything moved is a consumer reading forty documents to learn that
none of them changed.

WHAT IT COMPARES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO.

    facts       the tender's own published fields — deadline, status, value, CPV
    records     the page's document records, by id: publish date, title, and the digests
                of the files under each
    documents   the extracted text, addressed by the digest of the file it came from
    unreadable  the files no decoder could read, by their own digest

Every comparison is over sha256 of ORIGINAL bytes, never over the Markdown. That is the
line that keeps this honest: `normalize.py` is deterministic for a given version, but two
versions of it may render one unchanged PDF differently, and a diff taken over the Markdown
would report that as the buyer replacing a document. The extractor's fingerprint is carried
separately (`tool`), so "the text was extracted again" is a different sentence from "the
tender changed" and a reader is never asked to guess which one it is looking at.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A FACT. `register_check` and `eis_only` record how this tool came
to know about the procurement — by discovery, by a link on the page, or not at all. A
tender found through the register on Monday and fetched by id on Tuesday has not changed;
only the route to it has. Comparing them would report a change every time the caller varied
how it asked, which is the one kind of false positive that would train a reader to ignore
the whole file.

# yes becomes a no's opposite, and a timestamp keeps its instant while changing its wording.

# NONE OF THAT HAPPENS IN THIS TOOL, and the fields below are listed anyway. This register
# answers with codes, so there is nothing here to translate; see `page_language`.

# Compared blind, every one of these reports as an amendment on every language flip, for
# every tender in the run — the exact false positive this module's docstring says would train

# output turns an unrelated edit into a re-upload of every document of every tender ever
# fetched. The run's commit is exactly such a value — a corrected comment moves it.
#
# So it is a digest of the extraction path itself: the extractor, and the library versions it
# is pinned to. Editing this file, the delivery, or a test does not move it, because none of
# them can change a single character of the Markdown.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, SAID PLAINLY. The toolchain image is pinned by tag rather than by
# digest, and LibreOffice and Tesseract live inside it — so a rebuilt image can change the
