# The toolchain, pinned, so "same bytes in, same text out" covers the converters too.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND SPEED IS THE SMALLER HALF. `requirements.txt` is pinned exactly
# because a floating PyMuPDF is a floating text layer — but LibreOffice and Tesseract were
# installed by `apt-get` on every job, which fetches whatever Ubuntu is shipping that day.
# LibreOffice is what reads the Word 97 attachments buyers still send, and its version
# decides what that text looks like. So the determinism claim held for the Python half and
# quietly did not for the rest.
#
# The smaller half: installing them took ~60 s per job and, on 2026-08-07, seven minutes when
# the apt mirror was slow. A layer pull from the registry beside the runner is seconds and,
# more to the point, the same every time.
#
# Base is pinned by digest rather than by tag: `ubuntu:24.04` is a moving target, and a
# moving base defeats the whole purpose of this file.
